## Project Overview
This project implements a Sentiment Analysis system that classifies customer reviews as Positive or Negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
The model uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.
This task was completed as part of an internship assignment to understand text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Objectives
Perform text preprocessing on customer reviews
Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
Build a sentiment classification model
Evaluate model performance using accuracy and classification report
Visualize results using graphs

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)

## Dataset
Type: Customer Reviews Dataset
Columns:
review – Customer review text
sentiment – Sentiment label (positive / negative)
A large dataset was used to ensure better accuracy and model stability.

## Methodology / Workflow
Load the dataset
Clean and preprocess text data
Encode sentiment labels
Split dataset into training and testing sets
Apply TF-IDF vectorization
Train Logistic Regression model
Evaluate model performance
Visualize sentiment distribution and confusion matrix

## Results
The model achieved good accuracy using a large dataset
TF-IDF helped capture important textual patterns
Logistic Regression performed well for binary sentiment classification

## Visualizations
Sentiment Distribution Bar Chart
Confusion Matrix

## Analysis
Initial performance issues were resolved by properly cleaning and encoding sentiment labels.
Using a larger dataset significantly improved the model’s accuracy and stability.
This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing and feature extraction in NLP-based machine learning models.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates a complete Sentiment Analysis pipeline using Machine Learning.
It enhanced understanding of NLP preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation metrics, and result visualization using Scikit-Learn.
